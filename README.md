## Calling the script
Main call of the R code is in the ```R-0-Umbrella.R``` file, where all other files are sourced. 
This will produce all graphs in the subfolder plots, as well as store the test results in the variable ```test_results```. 

The data folder holds files that need unzipping before the analyses (done in the script though).


## Dependencies

R packages loaded in ```R-0-Umbrella.R``` are 

```R
library(phyloseq)
library(tidyr)
library(speedyseq)
library(dplyr)
library(viridis)
library(bipartite)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggsci)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
library(geosphere)
library(scales)
library(foreach)
library(doParallel)
library(doSNOW)
library(progress)
```
these can be installed via ``Ã¬nstall.packages()``` if not already installed.

## Computational requirements

Consider these analyses are quite intense and require at least 20GB of RAM, with > 24GB recommended. Most of the computational intensive tasks are parallelized, which means the more CPUs are available, the faster the processes. The function ``` makeCluster(cores[1]-2) ``` is used to estimate cores available, and will use all -2 of those.

Analyses for the article were performed on MacOSX 13.6.7 with a MacBook Pro Max M1 with 64 GB of RAM, 10 cores and R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14). From start to end, these analyses take using this device around 8 hours computational time. 

## Metabarcoding preprocessing: 

Preprocessing of metabarcoding was done according to: https://github.com/chiras/metabarcoding_pipeline
Some parts of the R Script also origin from this GitHub repository.
